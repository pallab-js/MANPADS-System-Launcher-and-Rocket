## Development Workflow

### Frontend (Next.js)
- Located in `src/`
- Components use Supabase-inspired design system (see `DESIGN.md`)
- State managed via Zustand in `src/store/`
- Run linter: `npm run lint`
- Type check: `npm run typecheck`

### Backend (Rust/Tauri)
- Located in `src-tauri/`
- UDP socket: `src-tauri/src/backend/udp/`
- SQLite storage: `src-tauri/src/backend/storage/`
- Tauri commands: `src-tauri/src/backend/commands/`
- Run tests: `cd src-tauri && cargo test`
- Build: `cd src-tauri && cargo build --release`

## Code Style

- **TypeScript**: Use explicit types, avoid `any`
- **Rust**: Follow standard conventions, use `rustfmt`
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS classes, see `DESIGN.md` for tokens
